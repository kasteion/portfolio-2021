          I am a software engineer based in Guatemala and have worked in IT for
          about ten years, and I must say I love it. I have practical experience
          in software development and systems administration. I am currently
          looking for opportunities to challenge myself and grow, working on
          great projects and helping people and companies achieve their goals
          and bring their ideas to life. Take a look at the things I can do and
          let's see if we can work together on your new project.
