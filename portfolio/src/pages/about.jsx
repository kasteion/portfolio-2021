        I am a software engineer from Guatemala with more than ten years of
        experience working in technology and software development. I have
        practical experience in all areas of software development and systems
        administration. I am currently looking for opportunities to challenge
        myself and grow working with a team of talented people on software
        projects at a fast pace and in an agile environment, helping users and
        companies achieve their goals and bring their ideas to life. Take a look
        at the projects i have been working on and lets see if we can work
        together on your new project.
